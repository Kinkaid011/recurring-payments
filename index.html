          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            The bill pay service in a mobile banking app is supposed to offer
            convenience and organization when handling your expenses. However,
            managing finances has become more of a hassle now than ever. A big
            factor in this issue is the rise of subscriptions. These small
            monthly payments are often forgotten and go under the radar. That
            makes it so frustrating when a surprise expenses throws off our
            budget. Financial institutions have taken notice of this and are
            attempting to provide solutions, but not all have been effective. I
            propose designing a feature in the Navy Federal banking app that
            tracks these recurring payments. This will assist their users in
            awareness and organizing their finances more accurately.

            <h3>Challenge</h3>
            <p>
              The challenge is to incorporate a feature in Navy Federal’s mobile
              bill pay service that helps track subscriptions and recurring
              payments. This tracking service is an extension to the bill pay
              section, but has a different goal and function. It should be
              design so that it’s very easy to use and not confused with
              automated billing.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p>
              By getting explicit permission from the user to monitor specified
              accounts, Navy Federal can create an ongoing list of recurring
              payments in a separate area of the Bill Pay section. This list
              will bring awareness to what subscriptions their users are paying
              for while also providing details of the total monthly cost that is
              being charged each month.

        <h2>Verifying the Problem</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            Right now Navy Federal has provided a solution for handling
            recurring payments by suggesting the answer is their automated
            billing feature. It even states From streaming subscriptions to gym
            memberships in the article. The idea is you don’t have to keep up
            with your recurring payments because we’ll pay them automatically.
            There are two problems with this solution. One, most subscription
            services have you enter your payment information when you sign up,
            so the automated billing is already taken care of. Two, automating
            payments can’t help with tracking subscriptions that users aren’t
            aware of.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>
            Another service Navy Federal has implemented is the snapshot
            feature. It works by using a predefined catalog of popular streaming
            services and sending an email to their users with how much they’ve
            spent in streaming over the past 3 months. However, not being able
            to view the catalog is an issue because the information can not be
            confirmed as accurate. This includes the analytics they provide.

      <div class="user-research section">
        <h2>User Research</h2>
        <p>
          I began my research by exploring the challenges people face in
          managing subscriptions, recurring payments, and their finances
          overall. Following this, I conducted a survey focused on subscription
          usage and management. The objective was to gain insight into how
          people use subscriptions and how effectively they manage them. The
          survey included six yes-or-no questions and was completed by 22
          individuals, all of whom have at least three active subscriptions. I
          specifically targeted this group to avoid surveying those who do not
          regularly use subscription services. The questions and results are
          outlined below.
        </p>

        <img class="question" src="./images/question-four.svg" alt="" />
        <img class="question" src="./images/question-five.svg" alt="" />
        <img class="question" src="./images/question-six.svg" alt="" />
      </div>

      <div class="insights section">
        <h2>Insights</h2>
        <p>
          The survey revealed that many respondents struggle with forgetting
          which services they subscribe to. This is especially true for services
          or products that aren’t typically associated with monthly
          subscriptions. While people are generally mindful of recurring
          expenses like WiFi, rent, and common subscriptions such as streaming
          and music services, they often forget about subscriptions that fall
          outside the norm.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another issue is organization. These small and similarly priced
          subscriptions are easy to mix up. If one factors in these payments
          coming out of different accounts and the overlap in billing cycle it
          only complicates the situation. This explains why so many have a hard
          time keeping up with subscriptions.

      <div class="user-personas section">
        <h2>Building Empathy</h2>
        <p>
          I created two user personas to help illustrate the data I collected
          from my research. I wanted to demonstrate how the issue of managing
          recurring payments affects different types of users, whether they are
          organized or not.

      <div class="journey-map section">
        <h2>Journey Map</h2>
        <p>
          After collecting data and learning about potential users, I created
          this journey map to capture how this new feature could be discovered
          and used. I also wanted to illustrate the thoughts and emotions
          throughout the experience.

        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>
            My initial wireframe sketches aimed for the ui to be as simple as
            possible. It consisted of the name, category, and cost of the
            subscription. Each subscription would have it’s logo attached for
            clarity and the total cost of all the subscriptions located at the
            bottom of the screen. After thinking it over, I realized this
            approach would take away from the consistency with the rest of the
            bill pay section. So when it came to the mockup I made them similar
            what’s there currently. The key differences are in the titles and
            the alert feature which tells the users of potentially new recurring
            payments monitored in the account.

      <div class="reflection section">
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          One of the first problems I came across while working on this case
          study is the confusion that could arise from talking about
          subscriptions and recurring payments. Even though I primarily wanted
          to focus on the issues that subscriptions had on finance managing, but
          I knew that every recurring payment wouldn’t be a subscription. I
          often thought about if using both in the project would cause issues.
          Another issue with this design is how to handle paused or canceled
          subscriptions. As of now, any subscription that’s not being charged
          would have to be removed manually. I’d want that process to be more
          automated
        </p>
        <p>
          Although I like my approach of a tracking tool instead of a full
          subscription management service, there are other features I believe
          would significantly improve what I’ve done so far. If time and budget
          allowed, I’d would like to find a way to incorporate accounts outside
          of Navy Federal. A downside to this current design is that it mainly
          works when all the recurring payments are tied to Navy Federal
          accounts. If a user has three subscriptions that are being paid with
          three different financial institutions, then it won’t make a
          significant impact.
